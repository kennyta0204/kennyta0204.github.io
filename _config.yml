  Hello! My name is Kenny and I am an aspiring data scientist with an overflowing passion for the field. I recently graduated from the Univrsity of Michigan, Ann Arbor with a Master's degree in Applied Data Science. Prior to my graduate studies, I studied Economics and Accounting during my undergraduate years and worked as a Tax Accountant for two years before pursuing Data Science. 

  I have a strong interest in predictive modeling with project experiences in various machine learning techiniques/algorithms such as natural language processing, regression modeling, neural networks, and more. Outside of machine learning, I am confident with SQL and have  dabbled with making simple web applications. My primary programming language is Python and I have limited experiences with Matlab.

          Ever have a friend come to you for advice regarding what car they should get? You hear their criteria and try to think of all the possible vehicles that fit their description but you could never think of all on the spot. I have been in this situation many times and have come up with a solution!

          This is my most recent project that I started as a means of touching up my sql skills. Through the process, I became overly invested in the project and have since went beyond SQL. I took what was meant to be a simple postgres database into a fully fledged working web application with a search and recommender function. Though this project, I learned HTML and simple CSS to serve as the backbone of my app's front end interface. To sum up my work, I aggregated data from various sources, created a postgres SQL database, trained and implemented an unsupervised learning model that finds similar vehicles using a custom defined distance metric, and coded a web app.

          You may be curious to know why I left the field of accounting. Although I found the job to be unfulfilling.

          As a Tax accountant working at a relatively small firm, I participated in nearly every service the firm had to offer. My duties includes tax preparation, tax consulting, bookkeeping, payroll preparation, tax law research, and more.

          Though my time as an accountant, I developed the ability to work in fast paced environments with extremely tight deadlines, the ability to think critically and problem solve, and the ability to work effectively in a team.

          Outside of my basic role, I also served as a humble inhouse IT, troubleshooting and solving various problems encountered by our computers, systems, and software.

          Truth be told, when I applied for the position, I was expecting the role to be more accounting and finance related.

          My primary duties was to record and process insurance claims. This position gave me the opportunity to work closely with data analysts who taught me how to write convoluted Excel VBA macro scripts.
          
          I participated in the implementation of a check tracking system in which a web application was developed to track payments above an amount threshold.

          During my time at this program, I acquired the key skills and knowledge required of a data scientist. I have learned to clean and preprocess various types of data, create stunning visualizations that comply with the grammar of graphics, train and evaluate machine learning/neural network models to solve complex problems, create pipelines to support such models, and interperet/share results.
          
          Other than the foundational courses one would expect out of a data science ciriculum, I have taken learning analytics, social media analytics and reinforcement learning.

          After spending two years at a community college, I transfered to the UCLA for a major in Economics. In addition to economics, I have taken every accounting/management course the institution had to offer. I wouldn't say I have a strong interest in either fields but I did develop a passion for econometrics, which would later inspire me to pursue data science.

    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      Alongside my interests in data science and machine learning some of my other interests and hobbies are:
      - Cars (Car enthusiast who is weak to old Japanese sports cars)
      - Gaming (Primarily crpg and retro rpgs)
      - App and Web development (although I just started)
      - Music (especially music with voice synthsizers, which involves deep learning)
