  Hello! My name is Kenny and I am an aspiring data scientist with an overflowing passion for the field. I recently graduated from the Univrsity of Michigan, Ann Arbor with a Master's degree in Applied Data Science. Prior to my graduate studies, I studied Economics and Accounting during my undergraduate years and worked as a Tax Accountant for two years before pursuing Data Science. 

  I have a strong interest in predictive modeling with project experiences in various machine learning techiniques/algorithms such as natural language processing, regression modeling, neural networks, and more. Outside of machine learning, I am confident with SQL and have  dabbled with making simple web applications. My primary programming language is Python and I have limited experiences with Matlab.

          Ever have a friend come to you for advice regarding what car they should get? You hear their criteria and try to think of all the possible vehicles that fit their description but you could never think of all on the spot. I have been in this situation many times and have come up with a solution!

          This is my most recent project that I started as a means of touching up my sql skills. Through the process, I became overly invested in the project and have since went beyond SQL. I took what was meant to be a simple postgres database into a fully fledged working web application with a search and recommender function. Though this project, I learned HTML and simple CSS to serve as the backbone of my app's front end interface. To sum up my work, I aggregated data from various sources, created a postgres SQL database, trained and implemented an unsupervised learning model that finds similar vehicles using a custom defined distance metric, and coded a web app.

          If you asked me for my greatest strength, I would say it is my creativity as I am able to think of many great ideas. If you asked for my weakness, I would say that I am overly optimistic as most of my ideas don't work as I had hoped.

          For the capstone project of my masters program, my team wanted to do a playfull project in which we would build deep learning models to generate lyrics for mainstream American artists. It was through this project where I learned the harsh reality that raw data does not always come clean with little issues. The dataset we acquired from Kaggle, was a lyrics dataset contributed by crowd sourcing. It was unstructured, full of spelling errors, and lacked a key feature we initially desired, the years in which the songs were written. One of my responsibilities, was to aggregate years via other sources, clean, and preprocess the data. On top of preprocessing the data, I created topic models and word clouds to summarize the main themes of an artist's discography.

          Prior to this project, I have built many machine learning models via scikit-learn. This was the project where I learned how to use TensorFlow and build a CNN model. Here, I was facing a data type that was foreign to me, 4-dimensional arrays in nifti format representing a complete 3D scan of a brain. My teammate and I built a CNN model to classify patients with dementia. In our analysis report, we compare the results of a Neural Network to that of a Random Forest model and a Naive Bayes probabilistic model in metrics of accuracy and recall. 

          In addition to this, we cluster patients with k-means, dbscan, and agglomerative clustering using features extracted from our CNN model to find correlation between our images with age, gender, and ground-truth dementia labels.

          As a Tax accountant working at a relatively small firm, I participated in nearly every service the firm had to offer. My duties includes tax preparation, tax consulting, bookkeeping, payroll preparation, tax law research, and more.

          Though my time as an accountant, I developed the ability to work in fast paced environments with extremely tight deadlines, the ability to think critically and problem solve, and the ability to work effectively in a team.

          Outside of my basic role, I also served as a humble inhouse IT, troubleshooting and solving various problems encountered by our computers, systems, and software.

          As an intern, I spent most of my time in office shadowing others. One of my mentors was a claims processor, which bestowed the task of recording and processing insurance claims. My primary function was to analyze claims data for errors, process the claims, record payments, and print checks. This role gave me insight on the payment process of an insurance company. Furthermore, I was given the opportunity to work closely with data analysts who taught me how to write Excel VBA macro scripts, in which I incorporated in my own recording duties. 
          
          In addition to my main responsibilities, I participated in the implementation of a 2-day check tracking policy where I worked with software developers by providing insight on necessary fields and functions to create an application that tracked the status of large payments.

          I worked part-time as a Medical Insurance Biller throughout my later years of highschool and early years of college as a means of supporting myself. 
          Here, I learned the inner-workings of the medical billing cycle including requesting authorizations, billing medical procedures, following up with claim statuses, and recording receivables. Other than my primary duty, I served as a front desk receptionist.

          In addition to medical billing, I worked on and off as a part-time math tutor to students at math levels ranging from elementary math to precalculus. It was through these experiences, I was able to find joy in teaching. I learned to get students engaged with math by incorporating humor and relatable examples with complex topics. By applying the same teaching methods I use on my students to my own self-learning, I was able to realize my personal enjoy in learning.

          During my time at this program, I acquired the key skills and knowledge required of a data scientist. I have learned to clean and preprocess various types of data, create stunning visualizations that comply with the grammar of graphics, train and evaluate machine learning/neural network models to solve complex problems, create pipelines to support such models, and interperet/share results.
          
          Other than the foundational courses one would expect out of a data science ciriculum, I have taken learning analytics, social media analytics and reinforcement learning.

          After spending two years at a community college, I transfered to the UCLA for a major in Economics. In addition to economics, I have taken every accounting/management course the institution had to offer. I wouldn't say I have a strong interest in either fields but I did develop a passion for econometrics, which would later inspire me to pursue data science.
